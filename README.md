    -   SCSS
    -   BEM
-   Create a page with a clear and coherent design

## Requirements

-   You need to have it as a public repository on GitHub
-   In the repo you will also need a README.md with a short intro to the project.
-   You are to use SCSS for styling.
-   You are to use B.E.M as a naming convention.
-   Responsiveness is vital â€“ use Grid, Flex, whatever you wish but the site must look good at all screen widths.
-   VERY CRITICAL! : You will need to make sure that your website looks good on phones, tablets and laptops (we will see Media Queries next week, docs to follow)

## Technology

-   GIT

## About the project

Seeing as this was my first project, I tried to experiment a lot and tried various things that werent specifically taught in the course. Originally I completed the project using vanilla HTML and CSS, however I spent a lot of time (much more than I expected) rewriting all the code using bootstrap in order to gain some experience with it.
Overall a great learning experience and a way to reinforce my skills!
